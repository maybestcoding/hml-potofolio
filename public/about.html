<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm currently working as a post office team leader in Londondrugs. 
  At the same time I also study coding for a software developer.</p>

<p>I like to play board games, so I try to play games every weekend.
  My most favorite game was Resistance and nowadays I'm really crazy about Catan.
  I love to spend time with my lovely cats. They give me lot's of joy and fun.</p>

<p>I like to learn and experience new things. Therefore I've been through various jobs
  such as English tutor, Immigration consultant, newspaper reporter,
  physiotherapist, etc. 
  I try to be easy going and to listen to others. I'm really happy to be surrounded
  by great people.</p>
